# Stay@Home Survival Kit for Families (#Stay@HomeSK4F)
*Stay@HomeSK4F* is an online community created to help families with young children spend the days of forced stay together in the most serene way possible.

## Inspiration (Why)
The project was created during the hackathon [EUvsVirus](https://euvsvirus.org) by a team of three. We are three parents with children aged between 2 and 4 who try to reconcile work duties with the family life. When The European Commission lauched a pan-European hackathon in order to develop innovative solutions for coronavirus-related challenges, we were already struggling day by day to find hacks to manage remote working, social distancing, business lockdown and school closure.  

When The European Commission lunch a pan-European hackathon in order to develop innovative solutions for coronavirus-related challenges we were already struggling to find hacks every day to manage remote working, social distancing, school lockdown.

Sharing our thought with colleagues, relatives, friends and other groups of parents, we realized that all families with children forced to stay at home are facing similar problems to ours. This situation can be difficult to manage and can create tension and disconfort in both adults and children.

As parents, we wondered what is the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children and what will be the long-term consequences will be. The amount of articles on the web has convinced us that our concerns are shared by many institutions, associations, newspapers, experts and ordinary people around the world.

The type and the amount of results on the web for a search like [https://www.google.com/search?q=COVID-19%20impact%20on%20kids]("COVID-19 impact on kids") has convinced us that our concerns are shared by many institutions, associations, newspapers, experts and ordinary people around the world.

Among all the institutional web pages, for example  [https://www.coe.int/en/web/children/covid-19](the one in the "Childrens Rights" section of the Council of Europe website) provides a summary of useful elements to deal with the situation.

Per raggiungere lo scopo alle famiglie servono tre cose:
strumenti di comunicazione per mantenere i rapporti sociali con altri adulti e bambini
supporto per organizzare attività educative e coinvolgenti per i bambini
il materiale necessario alle attività con in bambini 

La cosa migliore sarebbe avere tutte e tre le cose già disponibili in maniera ordinata in un solo posto in modo da poter dedicare più tempo possibile ai nostri figli. Servirebbe un Kit di sopravvivenza per famiglie costrette a restare a casa! Da queste riflessioni da nasce il progetto Stay At Home Survival Kit For Families (#Stay@HomeSK4F)

When young children are forced to stay at home they miss the social relations they usually have. They miss school, kindergarten, classmate, teachers,  playground, friends, grandparents, uncles and other people they usually met.

To overcome these shortcomings, parents are required to invent new engaging games and activities every day, while children keep asking to go out and we are all forced to stay at home.

It can be difficult for parents to organize educational activities that can involve children. Everything is even more complicated if parents also have to work from home and therefore have little time to organize activities with their children. Parents are busy with housework or struggle to keep focus on their job tasks surrounded by screaming kids, so children often are parked in front of a smartphone or tv for hours.

## What it does

Stay@HomeSK4F allows to maintain a high level of social interaction through **various channels and many multimedia communication tools** even without leaving home. 

The platform includes:
- message board
- instant messaging (IRC / #Slack style)
- audio / video call
- live event
- virtual classroom
- virtual laboratory for collaborative and interactive experiment
- multiplayer game environment

Families, groups of friends, schools, associations and other types of communities can create **private groups** on Stay@HomeSK4F and use the tools of the platform to continue their activities remotely in the best possible way.

Stay@HomeSK4F helps parents organize educational and engaging activities for their children by providing a **rich library** of educational paths, guides, games, courses, tutorials, experiments, books, articles and other resources of very high quality. All resources are organized by categories and age groups and tagged with topics for quicker search


Companies, educators, schools and other organizations can **contribute to the enrichment of the Stay@HomeSK4F library**. Proposals are evaluated by a experts board  and channel moderators before being made publicly available.

The authors of the contents are invited to indicate a way to find all the necessary material and can suggest "kits" prepared specifically to facilitate the purchase of the material by the parents. Manufacturers and retailers can promote products and services useful for carrying out the activities in the library within the **Stay@HomeSK4F marketplace**. All listings are rated by channel moderators must comply with the platform regulation.

When possible, authors are also invited to suggest how to use recycled and "domestic" materials commonly available at home (eg how to replace a commercial modeling clay with a homemade one with the recipe attached).

The purpose of Stay@HomeSK4F is not to sell products or services, but to help communities, children and families to face the difficulties of an unusual situation and a difficult period in the best possible way. 

Stay@HomeSK4Fits a platform that aggregates original content along with existing resources and tools from many sources with a strong focus on **content quality** and **user security**.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

## What I learned
Ho imparato che alcune cose per me sono ovvie non lo sono per altri e che alcune cose che per me sono difficili per altri sono facili e naturali. Mettendo a disposizione capacità, idee e competenze si possono ottenere benefici importanti per tutti.
Ho imparato ad utilizzare nuovi strumenti di produttività e collaborazione

## What's next for stay_at_home_family_kit
Start building a working online platform from the product concept defined in these days, also integrating other interesting complementary projects that we discovered during the hackathon.
